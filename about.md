Hello!

This blog is used for logging my endeavors in research, including summaries, the knowledge I got from study and communication with others and also some intresting insights of my future career. Hope the dots I met along this road could finally connect some beautiful sentences:).

For this moment, I'm a graduate with the major of bioinformatics, working in Life Science Institute, Zhejiang University. Also I'm a freshman editor for <a href="vip.biotrainee.com">biotranee, 生信菜鸟团<\a>
